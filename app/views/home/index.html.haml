      The Industry is a guild built around having fun while promoting a serious and professional atmosphere. The guild is founded on a conglomerate of experienced players, both hardcore and softcore, who have been traveling the MMORPG circuits for years. We pride ourselves about being a large guild with a focus on organization. We have a diverse playerbase that enjoys a mixture of content. We cultivate an environment that is casual friendly while still accomplishing goals.

          Organization: We have a strong emphasis on preparation and execution within the guild.
        %li
          Environment: This game is not a job, it is meant to be fun. Many hardcore guilds forget this. We make sure to always enjoy ourselves, even when stressful situations arise. We expect everyone, no matter their time commitment, to have a place within the guild.

        Other Guilds: If you're rolling onto Sorrow's Furnace, we're looking to form a WvW Alliance. We have plans to do things like an Alliance-wide Crafting Spreadsheet, In-house Structured PVP practice/tournaments, and advanced WvW strategies. If your guild leadership is interested in collaberating with us on something like this, you should contact us by email at WeIndustryNow@gmail.com.
